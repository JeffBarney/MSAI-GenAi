# **K-Drama Browser**: a tool for getting quick summaries of K-Dramas based on user sentiment and reviews

## Best Generated Output
I thought the best output from my model was for the drama titled "Blueming". The sample review read:

`a lot of people who are looking for a very good drama . i was looking forward to this drama . i was hooked . i initially thought i was a huge fan of seo yeon and ji hoon and the characters were amazing . i was looking forward to this drama . i loved how they were in high school and the cast was`

## Vision
The global streaming market for Korean dramas continues to surge, driven by platforms like Netflix, Viki, and Disney+. K-Dramas now attract global audiences across North America, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. However, with thousands of shows available, viewers struggle to efficiently evaluate what to watch next. Quick, sentiment-driven summaries can bridge this gap, improving content discovery and enhancing viewer satisfaction.

## Customer Personas

### Persona 1: Mina – The Casual Viewer
_Note: these personas are fictional, illustrative descriptions of potential customer segments._
Mina just finished her last show and is scrolling through a long list of K-Dramas. She doesn’t want spoilers but wishes she had a quick sense of whether a show is romantic, sad, or slow-paced. With **K-Drama Browser**, she can skim brief, tone-aware summaries to find her next pick.

### Persona 2: Daniel – The Content Curator
Daniel runs a K-Drama recommendation blog. He needs concise blurbs for each show but doesn’t have time to write them all. With **K-Drama Browser**, he can generate summaries based on real user sentiment and fine-tune them for his posts.

### Unmet Customer Needs
- Users want faster ways to assess tone and content of dramas without reading dozens of reviews.
- No existing tool turns crowd sentiment into concise, spoiler-free summaries at scale.
